## 📚 Description

Welcome to the Networking Basics project! Here, you'll discover the fundamental concepts of computer networks, from the OSI model to TCP/UDP ports and ICMP. This project is designed to help you understand how devices communicate and how networks operate at different layers.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to explain:

- **OSI Model**: What it is, its layers, and organization
- **LAN/WAN/Internet**: Usage and geographical size
- **IP Address**: Types, localhost, subnet, IPv6
- **TCP/UDP**: Protocols, differences, ports
- **Network Tools**: How to check device connectivity

---

## 📝 Requirements

- Bash script files
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- Scripts interpreted on Ubuntu 22.04
- All files end with a new line
- `README.md` at project root is mandatory
- Bash scripts must be executable
- Scripts must pass `shellcheck` without errors
- First line: `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- Second line: Comment explaining the script

---

## 🚀 Tasks

### 0. OSI model

- Understand the 7 layers of the OSI model
- Focus on Transport (TCP/UDP) and Network (IP/ICMP) layers

### 1. Types of network

- LAN, WAN, Internet: differences and use cases

### 2. MAC and IP address

- What is a MAC address?
- What is an IP address?

### 3. UDP and TCP

- Differences between TCP and UDP
- Data transfer reliability and speed

### 4. TCP and UDP ports

- What are ports?
- SSH (22), HTTP (80), HTTPS (443)
- Write a Bash script to display listening ports

### 5. Is the host on the network

- Use ICMP (ping) to check device connectivity
- Write a Bash script to ping an IP address
